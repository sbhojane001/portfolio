    "Data whisperer turning retail, e-commerce, and supply chain chaos into crystal-clear insights. I build predictive models that don’t just forecast the future — they help save millions while sipping on cloud tech (AWS & Azure). Whether it’s taming time series, fine-tuning marketing spend, or decoding customer behavior, I thrive on translating messy data into business wins. Basically, if it involves data and impact, I’m your go-to plot twist.",
